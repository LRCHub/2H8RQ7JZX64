```
He says “There's gotta be more
to this story”
She says “No, this our
happy end”
Once upon a melancholic time
they find that
love is a game of give & take
<♩>
This is what they call a fairy
tale,
a story about a girl
This is when she wakes up to the
sound,
the beating of her heart
This is why she puts her makeup
on
when he calls one Sunday night
This is where she falls in love
with him,
the boy who lives next door
It's not the car that he drives
or his money
and she couldn't give a damn
about the tattoos on the arm
he wraps around
But if only every once in while
he'd take a second to hit
the reply button
life would be easier
He says “There's gotta be more
to this story”
She says “No, this our
happy end”
Once upon a melancholic time
they find that
love is a game of give & take
He says “Where did I go wrong
in this story”
She says “Take a good look
around,
and you'd see”
Once upon a melancholic time
they find that
life is game of love & hate
<♩>
When tomorrow comes
it'll be the same
the same old game,
rewind and replay
another smile
another mistake again
turning a new page today
Ever since you came
into my dream
I want you to know
you changed my life
I won't say I love you
'cause
He says “There's gotta be more
to this story”
She says “No, this our
happy end”
Once upon a melancholic time
they find that
love is a game of give & take
He says “Where did I go wrong
in this story”
She says “Take a good look
around,
and you'd see”
Once upon a melancholic time
they find that
life is game of love & hate
